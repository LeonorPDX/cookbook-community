# Welcome to Cookbook Community

Cookbook Community is a Sinatra CRUD app. It allows users to create an account, log in, and log out; create, edit and delete their own recipes; browse other users' recipes; and save recipes to their personal Cookbook.

This app was developed as a portfolio project for Flatiron School's Online Software Engineering Program. The template for the app was created with Corneal, a Sinatra app generator that created the file directory and provided preliminary configuration.
